          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>I was introduced to HTML in my 10th class and since then I had an interest in web-development.
             I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap-4 to create front-end, and Node.JS, Express, MongoDB to create and connect to back-end. 
             I like to create beautiful and responsive websites and web-applications.
             Recently, I have developed an 'Exercise Tracker' by using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS). </p>

          <h3>C++</h3>
          <p>I had C++ in my 11th and 12th class. It was my first programming language. And I have learnt a lot of programming concepts from learning and coding in C++. I have created a small project i.e Student Management System by using C++ in which we can perform CRUD and search operation regarding students information. Here, I have used the concept of file-handling to store and retrieve the student's information.  </p>

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p> After learning C++, in my college I have learned Python programming language as it is easy to learn and understand as well as we can perform different operations by using simple syntax which are easy to write and read. Also, I am interested in learning Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and python is one of the best language for these technologies.</p>
